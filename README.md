## Main Concept
This is a Coen Brothers themed, timed trivia game. Users are able to "Start" to begin the game. They then have 10 seconds to answer each question. In between each question, users are told whether they answered the previous question correctly or incorrectly. They are also told what the correct answer was. If users run out of time on a question, it is considered an incorrect answer and they also receive a "Time's Up!" message. At the end of the questions, users are told how many answers they answered correctly, and how many they answered incorrectly. Finally, they have the option to try again.

## Technologies Used
HTML and CSS were used for styling and format. My purpose for creating this game was to gain a deeper understanding of jQuery and JavaScript functions. The script is written using jQuery.
